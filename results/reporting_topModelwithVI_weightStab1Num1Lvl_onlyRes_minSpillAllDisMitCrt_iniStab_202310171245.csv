green,timestep mapping,,superordinate dispatch level provided via options was used
yellow,technology mapping,carrier,some carrier of technology 'reservoir'  can be discharged but not charged
yellow,technology mapping,storage capacity,"in some cases limits prevent energy capacity for technology 'h2Cavern', but other storage capacity exists, therefore respective variables exist anyway"
yellow,technology mapping,storage expansion,"in some cases limits prevent energy expansion for technology 'h2Cavern', but other storage expansion exists, therefore respective variables exist anyway"
yellow,limit,expExc,"limits were provided without specificing the superordinate dispatch timestep, this means the sum over all years was limited instead of enforcing the same limit for each year (see https://leonardgoeke.github.io/AnyMOD.jl/stable/parameter_list/#Limits-on-quantities-dispatched)"
