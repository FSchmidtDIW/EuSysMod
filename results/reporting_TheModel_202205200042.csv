green,timestep mapping,,superordinate dispatch level provided via options was used
yellow,technology mapping,carrier,some carrier of technology 'reservoir'  can be discharged but not charged
yellow,exchange mapping,hvdc,"to allow for exchange between regions, residual capacities of any value (even zero) must be defined between them, but none were found"
yellow,exchange mapping,h2Transport,"to allow for exchange between regions, residual capacities of any value (even zero) must be defined between them, but none were found"
yellow,limit,expExc,"limits were provided without specificing the superordinate dispatch timestep, this means the sum over all years was limited instead of enforcing the same limit for each year (see https://leonardgoeke.github.io/AnyMOD.jl/stable/parameter_list/#Limits-on-quantities-dispatched)"
