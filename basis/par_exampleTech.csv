,,ccgt,,ccgtGas,,,effConv,0.6,costExpConv,3000,just an example,"expansion or operating costs always relate to input capacity, costs per output capacity (here electrical) have to be multiplied with the efficiency to obtain costs for input capacity"
,,ccgt,,ccgtGas,,,costOprConv,20,,,,"cost of operating capacity, for 'decomm' technologies the model will consider the trade-off between operating or decommissioning"
,,ocgt,,ocgtGas_chp,moreHeat,,effConv,0.8,,,just an example,"different modes are used to specific different operatinal parameters, here tradeoff between overall efficiency and chp ratio, 'effConv' give the overall conversion efficency"
,,ocgt,,ocgtGas_chp,moreHeat,districtHeat,ratioGenFix,0.4,,,just an example,"ratioGenFix' fixes the generation share of respective energy carrier, upper or lower limits and restricting use instead of generation possible as well"
,,ocgt,,ocgtGas_chp,morePower,,effConv,0.7,,,just an example,
,,ocgt,,ocgtGas_chp,morePower,districtHeat,ratioGenFix,0.3,,,just an example,
,,ocgt,ocgtH2CHP,,,,costExpConv,4000,effConv,0.5,just an example,values provided for node 'ocgtH2CHP' will for both sub-technologies 'ocgtH2_chp' and 'ocgtH2_chp_ind'
all,2020,hydrogenAndMore,,alkElectrolysis,,,effConv,0.7,,,just an example,
all,2025,hydrogenAndMore,,alkElectrolysis,,,effConv,0.7,,,just an example,"first timestep column relates to point of deployment, second column to year capacity is build, only for emerging technologies efficiency can differ by year capacity is build"
all,2030,hydrogenAndMore,,alkElectrolysis,,,effConv,0.7,,,just an example,
all,all(2035:2050),hydrogenAndMore,,alkElectrolysis,,,effConv,0.8,,,just an example,"same purpose as above, but an abbreviation is used to specificy the same value for three different years in a single line"
