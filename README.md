# EuSysMod

EuSysMod is a bottom-up planning model of the European energy system that optimizes expansion and operation of technologies and transmission infrastructure for the electricity, heating, transport, and industry sector. By default, the model covers the timeframe from 2020 to 2050 in 5-year steps under perfect foresight. It is an application of the [AnyMOD.jl](https://github.com/leonardgoeke/AnyMOD.jl) framework for energy system modelling.
